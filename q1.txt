b>
from the result, we can see that external data buffer is 3 times(no o2) fater than internal data buffer


i think the reason is, the internal data buffer locate memory on stack and every time we want a data from
buffer we have to do linear search on stack when we store them and output them (cout too many times)
but external data buffer have its own location and we do not need do linear search, we can just output as together(cout once)

c> after compiler with optimization turned on, internal data buffer get fater but still slower than external data buffer
and external data buffer remain same
